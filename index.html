            This website serves as my SIP and Boards portfolio. It documents the development
            of my Student Innovation Project and will continue to evolve throughout SIP311
            and SIP411 in preparation for my Boards presentation.

        <h2>Student Innovation Project (SIP)</h2>

        <h3>Project Title</h3>
        <p><strong>Cognitive Load-Aware Task and Learning Planner</strong></p>

        <h3>Innovation Claim</h3>
        <p>
            This project proposes a cognitive load-aware task and learning planner that
            prioritizes tasks based on mental effort and complexity rather than task quantity
            or deadlines alone. By integrating cognitive load principles into planning,
            the system aims to reduce cognitive overload and support sustainable productivity.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>
            The project focuses on designing a functional digital planner prototype that
            allows users to input tasks, assign cognitive effort levels, and receive
            system-generated task prioritization. The scope includes interface design,
            task categorization logic, and usability testing. Advanced AI automation is
            intentionally excluded to maintain feasibility within the SIP timeline.
        </p>

        <h3>Proof of Concept / Early-Stage Prototype</h3>
        <p>
            The proof of concept includes low-fidelity wireframes and a system flow diagram
            demonstrating task input, cognitive effort tagging, and system-generated task
            prioritization.
